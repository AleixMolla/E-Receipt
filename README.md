# E-Receipt

  This project was based in the idea of managing and storing the user receipts from store purchases into a phone app. Allowing easy access to receipts info and also showing the user expenses through several months to be able to calculate a budget.

  Created by Aleix Molla and David Adams, students at the University of Prince Edward Island as a final project of our course of CS-2130, MOBILE DEVICE DEVELOPMENT - ANDROID.
